          Sir Magdi Habib Yacoub (born November 1935), is an Egyptian-British
          retired professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Imperial College
          London, best known for his early work in repairing heart valves with
          surgeon Donald Ross, adapting the Ross procedure, where the diseased
          aortic valve is replaced with the person's own pulmonary valve,
          devising the arterial switch operation (ASO) in transposition of the
          great arteries, and establishing the heart transplantation centre at
          Harefield Hospital in 1980 with a heart transplant for Derrick Morris,
          who at the time of his death was Europe's longest-surviving heart
          transplant recipient. Yacoub subsequently performed the UK's first
          combined heart and lung transplant in 1983. From 1986 to 2006, he held
          the position of British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiothoracic
          Surgery at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College
          Faculty of Medicine.

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Magdi Habib Yacoub was born in November 1935 in Bilbeis, Al Sharqia,
            Egypt to a Coptic family, and spent his childhood moving around a
            number of different small towns. His father was a surgeon, who later
            worked in public health. He died in 1958. Yacoub later recalled that
            both his father and the death of his youngest aunt at age 22 years
            from an uncorrected mitral stenosis during childbirth inspired him
            to study medicine and cardiology, saying that “this young woman
            would not have died if we had had access to facilities which were
            then available in a few centres around the world”. At the age of 15,
            he entered the University of Cairo College of Medicine with a
            scholarship.

          <h3>Early surgical career</h3>
          <p>
            In 1957, Yacoub graduated in medicine from Cairo University and
            completed two years of residencies in surgery. In 1961 or 1962 he
            moved to Britain to study for his fellowship while working under Sir
            Russell Brock, consultant surgeon at Guy's Hospital. In 1964, he was
            appointed rotating surgical senior registrar to the National Heart
            and Chest Hospitals, where he worked with cardiothoracic surgeon
            Donald Ross. Here, they worked on repairing heart valves in people
            with severe valvular heart disease and heart failure. At a time when
            cardiologists may have been reluctant to refer for surgery, Yacoub's
            search for operable people earned himthe name "Magdi's midnight
            stars".

          <h3>Later Career</h3>
          <p>
            He retired from the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of
            65. In 2006 he led a complex operation which required removing a
            transplant heart from a person whose own heart had recovered. The
            original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly
            a decade earlier, in the hope it might recover. In April 2007, it
            was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had
            grown part of a human heart valve from stem cells. he continued to
            operate on children through his charity, Chain of Hope. In 2008, he
            co-founded the Magdi Yacoub heart foundation, which launched the
            Aswan Heart project.
